GoProController
===============

A lightweight Python class for interfacing with multiple GoPros.

This Python class alls another program to interface with multiple GoPro cameras when the cameras are in their wifi ad-hoc mode (aka GoPro App mode.) This class can automatically jump between multiple wireless networks to create the illusion of simultaneous control.
